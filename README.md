# NES Games Disassembly

Each disassembly is equal to the original ROM, compilable and editable.



## How to build

No special requirements. Just launch **assemble.bat** and wait until it's done.



## How to edit

Use **syntax_6502.xml** to highlight code in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

Go to Language -> User Defined Language -> Define your language -> Export.

My personal comments are marked with **bzk** text. Start with deleting garbage to free up some space.
