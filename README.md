# NES Games Disassembly

Each source code is equal to the original ROM, compilable and editable.



## How to build

No special requirements. Just launch `assemble.bat` and wait until it's done.



## How to edit

Use `syntax_6502.xml` to highlight code in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

Go to Language -> User Defined Language -> Define your language -> Import.

My personal comments are marked with `bzk` text. Start with deleting garbage to free up some space.

And don't worry about stuff like `C - - - - - 0x00009C 00:C08C: A9 00     LDA #$00`.

Lua script will take care of it before compilation. You just write new code as usual, like this `LDA #$00`.
